### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Controlled Filtering**: To ensure a smooth and deliberate user experience, filters (name, address, price) will be applied via a clear "Apply Filters" button, preventing jarring screen updates while the user is still inputting their choices.
- **Dual-Mode Property Viewing**: Users will have two ways to view property details:
  1.  A "Quick View" modal for rapid browsing of key details without leaving the listings page.
  2.  A dedicated, immersive "Details Page" for a comprehensive look at a single property.

### Core Screens and Views

- **Homepage / Landing Page**: The initial entry point that establishes the premium brand and guides users toward the property listings.
- **Property Listings Page**: The main view displaying the grid of properties, including the primary filtering controls.
- **Property Detail Page**: An immersive view showing all information for a single property.
- **Search Results: Empty State**: A gracefully designed page that informs the user when their search criteria return no results and suggests alternative actions.
- **Search Results: Error State**: A page to handle cases where the property data fails to load, ensuring a professional user experience even during technical issues.

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

The application should adhere to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA to ensure it is usable by all potential clients.

### Branding

High-end branding guidelines (logos, a sophisticated color palette, elegant typography) are critical and must be provided to achieve the desired luxury aesthetic.
